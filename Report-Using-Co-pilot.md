## Issues using A.I

- sometimes the certain section provided by copilot is good in itself but it doesn't fit in well with the previously
  written code.
- doesn't consider the level of coder into account - I can't understand all levels of code
- if you are not familiar with what that code is exactly supposed to do - you spend way too much debugging it when the
  bug
- It's hard to get specific generalised code
    - e.g. write me code to handle both GET and POST request in python, it gives a hardcoded way to extract just GET or
      just POST, but not an abstracted away method
- Well, I realised, I can't use co-pilot for everything, as then I won't know the overall structure of program, and that
  makes it hard to have the co-pilot do things for me.
- Copilot isn't good at incremental changes - as in if I ask it to write function for something and ask it to change a
  certain section of the generate code snippet - that is build on top of existing code, it tends to regenerate the code
  from scratch
-

## Good to have:

- suggestions on how to improve my code - how would this look like
- the thought process - as in - explanation for why it choose that specific code
    - e.g. the internal dialog - the structure of the request is in this format so we'll use this
-

## Good things about it

- makes learning so much faster
- don't have to waste time googling the syntax
- it focuses on - ask good questions, and in order to ask better questions you need to articulate yourself better and
  keep increasing your knowledge of that domain.
- It's a good - work along side partner for now - its now good at doing the whole thing for you
- Sometimes it generates code which I wouldn't had thought about - so I get exposed to different and sometimes newer
  ways (more advanced). E.g.
  ```java
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
          if (this == o) return true;
          if (!(o instanceof HazardCard)) return false;
          HazardCard that = (HazardCard) o;
          return Objects.equals(hazardType, that.hazardType);
      }
  ```

- Project Scaffold: GOOD : I setup a node project scaffold but that I did manually at incremental rates
- Project Scaffold: BAD : When AI generated the classes for me - I had no clue about the code flow, how and why
  something was created so ended up heavily editing it.

## Wondering??

- if it'll teach me git-github faster
- I'll add changes at the same spot
- trying LIVE-SHARE of VS-Code
- Checking symbolic link to see if both are same
- I think the good thing about humans over AI will be - yes AI learns very fast, but humans can build on top of things.
  As in, a lot of mundane things - AI can do that, maybe even better than us. But then once AI is done, then we can
  acknowledge what has been done so far and then take it a step ahead. Coz humans need it for humans, unless AI uses
  data tracking from Meta and things and start controlling our behaviour based on the shadow profile just very little at
  a time changing your mentality.
